            <strong>huge</strong> lack of easily and quickly understandable content to get into the game, especially in
            <strong>French</strong>. So, since I am training in web development, I thought: why not create a website 
            gathering the information I found about StarCraft for beginners?`,

For now, I have only gathered the information I found, but it is not always accurate or relevant. As I have often noticed, there are many nuances. The goal is to provide general guidelines on how to react to an opponent's composition, which is especially useful for beginners like me. The subtleties of counterplays come with experience.",
